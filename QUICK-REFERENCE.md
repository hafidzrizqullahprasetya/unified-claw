| **Total** | **14** | **2 weeks** | **28 hours** |

## 📋 What to Produce (Week 2)

- [ ] **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System design (500-800 words)
- [ ] **schema-planning.md** - Database tables, relationships, indexes
- [ ] **API.md** - 40+ API endpoints documented
- [ ] **COMPETITIVE-POSITIONING.md** - Your unique value prop
- [ ] **5-Patterns-I-Will-Clone.md** - Pattern notes with examples
- [ ] **DEVELOPMENT.md** - Setup & contribution guide
- [ ] Folder structure created in `/src/`
- [ ] Git commit with all documents

## 💡 5 Patterns to Clone from OpenClaw
1. **Plugin Registry Pattern** - Dynamic plugin loading
2. **Dependency Injection Pattern** - Loose coupling, easy testing
3. **Event-Driven Architecture** - Message-based communication
4. **Error Handling & Retry Logic** - Graceful failure handling
5. **Type System & Validation** - Zod + TypeScript strict mode

## 🚀 Your 5 Innovations
1. **Context-Aware AI Agent** - Understands customer, order, inventory
2. **Multi-Gateway Payment Routing** - Smart gateway selection
3. **Agentic Workflow Engine** - AI-powered order automation
4. **Unified Reporting & Analytics** - AI-powered business insights
5. **Compliance & Tax Automation** - Indonesia-specific: SPT, taxes

## ✨ Key Insights
| Insight | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| OpenClaw is NOT finance platform | You must build finance layer from scratch |
| Clone PATTERNS not CODE | Patterns are timeless, code is context-specific |
| 2 weeks planning saves 8 weeks rework | Good architecture is worth the planning time |
| You're not just building another OpenClaw | Your innovations in AI, payments, and compliance are unique |
| Indonesia UMKM market is huge | First unified platform targeting this market |
